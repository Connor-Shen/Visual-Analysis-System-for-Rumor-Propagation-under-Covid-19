# Visual-Analysis-System-for-Rumor-Propagation-under-Covid-19
In this project I design a rumor visualization system for visualizing rumors in social networks during the epidemic. I conduct topic modeling of the rumor dataset and explore the changes in topics over time and region. Geographical rumor distribution is also performed and visualized in the form of China map.
